# Perceptron-algorithm-using-perceptron-training-rule-

Implement the perceptron algorithm (use the perceptron training rule and not
the gradient descent rule). Your task here is to experiment with different
values of number of iterations and the learning rate. Report the accuracy for
20 suitable combinations of number of iterations and the learning rate. Repeat
your experiment by filtering out the stop words. Compare the accuracy of
your perceptron implementation with that of Naive Bayes.
